# nwnrs-types

Minimal weighted least-recently-used cache.

## Scope

- store cached values with an explicit weight
- evict entries by recency subject to a total weight budget
- provide the small cache behavior needed by [`crate::resman`] and [`crate::tlk`]

Use `WeightedLru` when eviction should be based on approximate byte size rather
than item count alone.

## Public Surface

- `Weight`
- `WeightedLru`

## Logical Edges

- the cache is weight-driven, not item-count driven
- it exists to support workloads where a small number of large items can
  dominate memory pressure
- the crate intentionally does not model persistence, sharding, invalidation
  policy, or distributed behavior

## See also

- [`crate::resman`], which uses this cache for weighted resource payload
  eviction
- [`crate::tlk`], which uses this cache for lazy stream-backed dialog-table
  entries

## Why This Crate Exists

`ResMan` and other consumers need cheap bounded caching, but "N items" is a bad
policy for variable-sized binary payloads.
